This file is where the overall description of the project would go.

Instead I will use this area to mention the important files that are used in the design of the display:

BehaviorDashboard
README.md
venv
pyvenv.cfg
dashboard
models.py
dashboard
settings.py
dash_ui
models.py
urls.py
views.py
templates
scratch.html
test_database.html
Notes: The pyvenv.cfg may need to be changed based on the computer that the code is downloaded on (more info in my report). The models.py found under dashboard will be overwritten every time you load the specified line (found in models.py under dash_ui) to gather new database tables, so no comments have been left within the script. The README.md should eventually be updated to outline the complete setup of the code along with a description of what the entire application accomplishes.
